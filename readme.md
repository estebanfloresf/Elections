# Ecuador - Election 2017

This is mostly a project I am developing as a self-learning project based on tools like

* ![Jade/Pug](/public/images/photos/jadepug.ico "Jade/jadepug") Jade Pug
* ![D3 library](/public/images/photos/d3.ico "D3") D3 library
* ![Node JS](/public/images/photos/nodejs.ico "Node JS") Node JS

## What's inside

Is a simple webpage to showcase in a nicer way the data of the
Presidential Elections held in Ecuador in 2017.

## Installation

To get started:

* Download or Clone this repository
  * `npm install`
  * `npm start`

I decided to make this project basically because there was no good information related
to the data showcased by the National Election Council (CNE), there was no good visual representation of the data
and most importantly, there was no open data to share about the final results.

Here is a little sneak peek:
