This is mostly a project I am developing as a self-learning project based on tools like

## What's inside?

Is a simple webpage to show case a in a nicer way the data of the
Presidential Elections held in Ecuador in 2017.

## Sharing is Caring

So why I decided to do it? Basically, because there was no good information related
to the data showcase by the National Election Council (CNE), there was no good visual representation of the data
and most importantly, there was no open data to share about the final results.

Here is a little sneak peek:
